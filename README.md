# Mickey-Mouse-OpenGL-Drawing
This project is a 2D graphical rendering of Mickey Mouse using OpenGL and C++. It uses basic geometric shapes like polygons and circles, layered with color and shading to create a cartoon-style character. It's a beginner-friendly OpenGL project to practice drawing complex figures with modular shape functions.
