# Mickey Mouse OpenGL Drawing

## ðŸ§  About the Project
This is a simple 2D Mickey Mouse drawing created using OpenGL in C++. The project uses basic functions like polygons and circles to construct the full body of the character, including hands, legs, face, and details like eyes and mouth. It demonstrates how creative shapes and trigonometry can be used to build cartoon characters in computer graphics.

## ðŸ’» Technologies
